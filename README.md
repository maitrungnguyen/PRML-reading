About This Repository

This repository documents a reading and learning project conducted by Mai Trung Nguyen (University of Science, VNUHCM), under the guidance of Prof. Dau Hai Dang (Nanyang Technological University).

The project serves as a structured record of my study of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop. It includes detailed notes, derivations, explanations, and Python-based implementations of key concepts from the book.

The notebooks are organized to follow the structure of the textbook, covering both theoretical understanding and practical experimentation. Each section aims to:

- Summarize important theoretical foundations.

- Reproduce mathematical derivations.

- Implementation in Python. 

- Provide visualizations or simulations.

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in probabilistic modeling, statistical inference, and machine learning techniques through active reading, coding, and experimentation.
